# Incaper Data Management System

This repository encompasses the development of a robust Data Management System for the Espírito Santo Research, Technical Assistance, and Rural Extension Institute (INCAPER). The primary goal of this project is to convert information derived from analyses conducted in Soil laboratories, Plant Tissues Laboratory, and Soil Chemistry Laboratory into digital data. The outcome is a sophisticated software solution designed to efficiently manage data and generate detailed technical reports.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly integrates information from Soil laboratories, Plant Tissues Laboratory, and Soil Chemistry Laboratory.
- **Digital Transformation:** Converts raw analytical data into a structured digital format for improved accessibility and usability.
- **Report Generation:** Enables the automated creation of comprehensive technical reports based on the processed data.
- **Link to Book Chapter:** A detailed description of the project and its implementation can be found in the associated [book chapter](https://s3.amazonaws.com/downloads.editoracientifica.com.br/articles/200400052.pdf).
